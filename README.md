# Project Overview
Cars make our lives more convenient but have shortcomings as well. First, it is well known that car emissions have high effects on air pollution. Another worrying issue is the high operational costs incurred from high fuel prices which in turn leads to rise in cost of living. 
In Kenya, fuel prices are on the higher end of the scale and tend to skyrocket every so often. Research on what affects vehicle fuel usage and emissions shows that driving behaviour accounts for 45% of causative factors. The proposed project seeks to create a system that monitors driving behaviour in
terms of vehicle parameters such vehicle speed, engine RPM, acceleration etc collected via the onboard diagnostics module and offers per trip analysis of fuel consumed and the estimated fuel cost based on prevailing market prices. The tool also classifies the driving behaviour as fuel efficient or not and offers comments on the cause of the classification result.

The key characteristics of the system include:
- Collection of vehicle onboard information
- Driving behaviour analysis using Adaboost Algorithms based on the collected data and identification of factors that affect fuel use
- Per trip analysis of fuel consumption and costs
